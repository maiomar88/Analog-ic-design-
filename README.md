# Analog-ic-design-
Here i display some general schematics for my 3 Mini projects that i have worked on during ITI-Training with Dr.Hesham Omran with it's required spece and that i acheived
with a small summery for them taken from: https://www.master-micro.com/professional-courses/analog-ic-design/course-resources#h.i4wd26i3ll2m 


## Lab 9(Mini project1)

-generate and use gm/ID design curves and learn to use ADT assisstance
- design a two-stage Miller OTA achieving given specifications through simulate the small-signal differential gain,small-signal common-mode gain,the large-signal      differential in the open-loop 
-simulate closed-loop through simulate the large-signal differential ,the large-signal common-mode..etc
-use dc closed-loop configuration to simulate an ac open-loop configuration.




## Lab11(Mini-projec2)

- design a fully-differential folded-cascode OTA achieving given specifications.
-simulate the open-loop characteristics of the fully-differential folded-cascode OTA throgh simulate the small-signal differential with an ideal & Actual CMFB.
-simulate the closed-loop configuration with a real CMFB circuit.
- simulate the stability of both the main OTA loop and the CMFB loop .
- design the common-mode feedback circuit for the OTA.
-simulate the output swing of both the main OTA loop and the CMFB loop
-simulate the stability of both the main OTA loop and the CMFB loop  using transient simulation.



## Lab12(Design challange)

here i know how analog is very challangable anf joyful it's very nice design with tough specs:
- i learn how to run coreners through the design for open &closed loop 
acheving it's specs is a VICTORY in the start of my way 
-select a proper circuit topology ,design an analog circuit on my own.
-implement a digitally controlled analog circuit and show how variations affect the circuit


 Finally i would like to Thank DR. HESHAM OMRAN throughout the course.
